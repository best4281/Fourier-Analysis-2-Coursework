# **Interactive 2D Fourier Analysis and filters**

This is the repository for source codes used for analysis in final coursework challenge of ***Fourier Analysis 2*** in winter quarter of 2021.
In this repository, you will find the interactive experience of how image filters work with the manipulation of image spectrum (Fourier Transformed 2D image).

## **Background**
In short, after I found out that Fourier Transform can also be done to 2 dimensional image. I want to use my programming skill to make an interactive experience for us to discover and deepen the understanding of this amazing use of Fourier Transform. Therefore, I have made a program to apply image filter (which is actually convolution in color domain, or multiplication in Fourier domain). Moreover, I have left some part of the codes out, for the classmates to take the challenge and make some image filter as well.

For further background and how Math Magic work, read [the report here](link to be added).

## **Warning**
I have tried my best to ensure that the codes in this repository will work in many platform as possible. However, due to my limited time and access to platform other than Windows, I cannot ensure the compatibility for other platform. But please contact me, or open issue in this repository, and I will try to address it as soon as possible.

**Tested platform:**
 - [x] Windows - specifically *Windows 11 Version 21H2 (OS Build 22000.469)*

Also, the performance of the program might vary from system to system. 
The interactive eraser in file [`fft_eraser.py`](./fft_eraser.py) is the one with worst performance. But in optimal circumstance, this file should let you remove any frequency in the spectrum with the built in eraser like shown in [features section](#features).

## **Setup**
1. Download this repository to your computer by clicking the green **`Codeâ–¾`** button above and download ZIP file.
2. Extract zip file using the program of your choice (such as 7-zip), you will get a folder that contains every file in this repository.
3. Ensure you have at least Python 3.6 installed in your system. If not, download and install Python from [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Open the command line in the extracted folder. Then, using your preferred package manager (*`pip` in this case*), install all required libraries for this project using the command below
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or install them individually using this command instead
```Shell
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```
5. 2 python files in the topmost directory ([`fft_eraser.py`](./fft_eraser.py) and [`main.py`](./main.py)) can now be compiled and executed

## **Features**
### [main.py](/main.py)
Applying filters to the Fourier Domain of the input picture. There are slider(s) to change the parameter of the applied filter. 
This is also where you will have to do the challenges.

### [fft_eraser.py](./fft_eraser.py)
This is only a playground (but a unstable and laggy one).
You can use the eraser to erase the part of the unwanted frequency in Fourier domain (experimental).

## **Challenges**
### **Challenge 1: Ideal Low Pass Filter**
When you opened the [main.py](/main.py) file, you will be greeted with some part of codes that have been commented out.
You just have to ignore it and run the file for the first time. But with your knowledge from what we have heard in our ***Fourier Analysis 2*** (Challenge number **3**), You noticed that there is one missing type of filter for you to select. (Aside from the fancy Gaussian filters)
Yes indeed, the low pass filter is missing from the filter selection panel. Don't worry, this is intentional ,and also your first challenge.
#### Instruction
Using the outline code in [main.py](/main.py), complete the function `ideal_low_pass_array` to make the low pass filter work when the program runs. 
This function should take the dimension of the array (`rows` and `columns`), and the radius or `cutoff frequency`. 

The output is expected to be 2 dimensional array with specified dimension. This output must also be ready to multiply with the Fourier transform spectrum (via matrix multiplication).
This means each member of the array **must** have value only 0 or 1 (since this is an ideal filter).

Further instruction is provided using comments in [main.py](/main.py).
After the implementation, **don't forget to add the function to interactive figure by using the code in commented area**
When the filter is working in the interctive figure, try applying different values of `cutoff frequency` (aka radius). Then discuss about what does the ideal low pass filter does to the image.

## **Closing words**
Thank you for attempting this coding challenge. I know some of you are not familiar or good at programming, so I have tried my best to use my programming skill to make a program to visualize this concept.
I put in my effort to make the file you are editing (maybe) easier to read/understand. I apologize in case this challenge is too hard for some people, but ad least I hope you get the picture of how Fourier Transform and filter works on digital image.
